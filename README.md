# smtp-server-node4

smtp-server-node4 is a small modification to
[smtp-server](https://nodemailer.com/extras/smtp-server/)
to run on Node 4 (and higher), whereas the official
smtp-server [runs only on Node 6](https://nodemailer.com/about/#requirements)
(and higher).
Version numbers run parallel to
[nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smtp-server).

The modifications are by Erik Demaine, while Nodemailer itself
is by Andris Reinman.  All distributed under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).
